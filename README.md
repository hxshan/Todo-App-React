## My process

### Built with
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind Css]([https://styled-components.com/](https://tailwindcss.com)) - For styles
### What I learned
This was a good practice project to understand and practice using React and using its hooks. <br>
I also got to work with [Dnd Kit](https://dndkit.com) for the implementation or a draggable and rearrangeble <br>


### Continued development

prolly making this a full stack app maybe
